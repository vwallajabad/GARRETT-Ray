Overview
---
G.A.R.R.E.T.T RAY (Gas-balloon Array for Ray Research: Emission Timing Tracker) is a project for Hack Club's Apex, in which our project, and similar projects from other groups, will be launched on a weather balloon in Boston this summer. In this project, we are planning on launching a sensor on the balloon to detect cosmic rays at different altitude levels. Our tracker will be based on the CosmicWatch project, which uses a scintillator to detect particles. The data will be tracked on an SD card, and, after the flight, we will connect and analyze the data to find the relationship between the frequency of cosmic rays per minute with the altitude of the tracker.

Data
---
The main forms of data we are tracking are as follows:
* Cosmic Ray Frequency
* Altitude
* Time Stamps for Altitude/Cosmic Ray data

With this data, we aim to be able to analyze the relationship between cosmic ray frequency and altitude.

Hardware
---
*CosmicWatch PCB
* Arduino Nano
* SD Card
* Real Time Clock
* Insulated Box
* Batteries
* Power Switch

During this time frame, our main focus was on getting the project approved and getting our parts ordered. We made our project proposal which can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ost-K2Dkp49aPkbqhb2MIPfQj7q0qgYn6kRJGQYj6K8/edit?usp=sharing), and once the project was approved we began to plan out our design/construction and got our parts ordered. We focused on ordering the PCB and the components that must be soldered to it, as we believed that would be the longest step and we thought we would get enough hours from this to have another one of our teammates hit the 30 hours mark, allowing us to get more another $100 grant to put towards more parts.

Today, Kyle began by updating our readme to better describe the project and be more up to date. He then moved on to researching airfare in an attempt to find tickets that fell within the $400 per person stipend. Varun also researched airfare, and he was able to find tickets from an airport a few hours away from us that fit within our budget. Ideally we would be able to fly from our local international airport, but the cost seems prohibitive. 

Later that evening, Kyle and Garrett met up in person to work on soldering components to the PCB, since we chose not to get PCBA for our order to save money. We began working on the SD card PCB with Garrett soldering the components on and Kyle finding each component and getting it out of the bag. We found that it was faster to use soldering paste and a heat gun than it was to use solder and a soldering iron. This approach saved us quite a bit of time and we believe we should be able to get the rest of the boards done relativley quickly.

Kyle updated the journal and continued to look into travel. The three main approaches he looked at were renting a car, taking a bus, and finding a cheap flight. Turo would allow Garrett to rent a car, but he would be the only one able to drive it since the Varun and Kyle are not old enough for Turo's insurance. The Grayhound bus would have been very slow, however it would have been more affordable and was worth keeping around as a last resort. Kyle was also able to find cheap flights through frontier that would fit within our stipend, but these would add a travel day to and from Boston compared to direct flights. Once again, we are keeping these as a last resort option, but direct flights would be preferable. After talking with Varun, he had some luck finding a more direct flight yesterday, but we still need to look further into the trustworthyness of the website he was using.
